### There are my solutions to the advent of code 2023.

They were all written by myself, mostly without any help, but here are some exceptions:
- day 12 part 2: I used a solution from reddit to help me debug my optimizations (to find which examples are wrong), after succesfully debugging and still being too slow, I used a hint to use memoization.
- Day 20 part 2: I used a hint to look into the configuration of output module inputs and use lcm.
- Day 24 part 2: Had no idea how to solve a system of non-linear equations. Looked into solutions for hints and then used SymPy library, which feels like cheating.

Usually I woke up at 6:00 and was coding until I succeded, with some exceptions:
- Day 16 and 17: I had some other things in my life and was unable to solve in the short morning.
- Day 18: Woke up later, as my roommate - my sister had master's exam (had to learn most of the important courses from 5 years of mathematics study) and she deserves an uninterrupted sleep.
- Day 22: Too tired to wake up.
- Day 23 part 2: Also other things in life, I was unable to finish optimizations for part 2 in the morning, but my computer was able to finish computing unoptimized solution in 10 hours.
- Day 24 and 25: I had no time for subsidiary things, as I was prepairing for and celebrating the bith of the Redeemer. *"For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace."* Isaiah 9:6
